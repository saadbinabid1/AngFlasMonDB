# AngFlasMondb
This is a demonstration project targeting a particular web-development stack.
I have developed Web application using Angular, Python (Flask) and MongoDB. The example application is for grocery shopping. 
This application helps the customer to add items and tasks to the grocery shopping list. Main interface of the Application is shown in Figure-1.

The customer can add the grocery shopping items/tasks to the list (Shown in Figure-2)

If the customer thinks he put a wrong grocery item. He can change the grocery shopping item/task in the listing (Yellow part has been added.)
![Figure 3- You can also change the text of the grocery buying task](https://github.com/saadbinabid1/AngFlasMondb/blob/master/Demo_Pictures/pic3.GIF)

Once the customer thinks he has finished buying the grocery item or have done the task. He/she just push the done button and the grocery buying task is added to the done listing. As shown in Figure-4.
